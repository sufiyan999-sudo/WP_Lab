            <h2>The Future of Layout: What's Next?</h2>
            <p>As CSS Grid continues to mature, developers and browser vendors are exploring new possibilities for web layouts. Subgrid support is expanding, allowing nested grids to inherit track sizing from their parent containers. Container queries are on the horizon, promising to make component-based design even more powerful. The combination of Grid with other modern CSS features like Custom Properties and Flexbox creates endless possibilities for innovative, performant web designs that push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.</p>
